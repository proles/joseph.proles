                                          <p data-part="one" class="limit">On a summer afternoon after our breakfast/lunch shift ended at the diner in Emigration 
                                          Canyon, in Mulligan’s where those of us who loved those of us congregated, we shot 
                                          darts, sipped beer, and intermittently shot shots of cheap whiskey while the pale glow of 
                                          the sun reached through the open front door of the shotgun bar reminding us that there 
                                          was always something else out there. We didn’t dollar up the jukebox because Michael 
                                          always played the old hits and Classic Rock was a practice we three were reared in. Isaac 
                                          and Megan were lovers meant for only a short time, and that may have been why each of 
                                          them entertained the daytime debauchery that I was always so prone to. I lived across the 
                                          street in a studio we referred to as the Shoe Box—200 sq. ft. of soft green carpet and 
                                          whitewashed walls where we joked one could take a shit and fry an egg at the same time. 
                                          And on that day when the bar was empty and we were drinking after a long shift in the 
                                          canyon being terrorized by busloads of senior sightseers and demands of more ketchup 
                                          and condiments while we pulled Champagne shots at bent knee behind the patio bar, we 
                                          were drunk, but not that drunk. We were loving, but unsure about that love’s origins. 
                                          And from twenty feet away, crowding each other in a tan vinyl booth with arms latched 
                                          to shoulders and cheeks and lips at near embrace, I whipped a dart through the air and 
                                          called out: We shoot our whiskey and sip our darts. The plastic-feathered arrow sung true 
                                          through the nicotine fog and landed in the dead-center-dot of the red, pockmarked, 
                                          plastic dartboard and the machine buzzed out a dull, game-show-drone to let us know we 
                                          had to pay to play. The bull’s eye was dead-eyed and Isaac’s face sank in the wake of his 
                                          whooping, jubilant lover. I’ll never be that cool, he said. And meant it with conviction.</p>

                                          <h4>Spontaneity and forensic aesthetics.</h4>

                                          <p>In her essay “Dickinson’s Misery”, Virginia Jackson argues that the “lyric emerged as the one genre indisputably literary and independent of social contingency.” She makes this claim while also asserting that other genres—dramatic genres, the essay, the novel—are all bound to those social contingencies that the lyric so fluidly avoids. I would not contend to make a formal statement about the status of the lyric in all of its incarnations and imaginative forms, but what this project will do is explore the current status of the essay, and that, beyond formal measures and limitations, more so bound to the experience of the lyric, the attributes of what may now be called the lyric essay overlap almost one-to-one with what is translated between writer-as-creator and reader-as-activator.</p>
                                          <p>Jackson claims that the emergence of the lyric is a modern one. It developed in the nineteenth century with the Romantics and the dissemination of printed text. And for historians and scholars, this phenomena has produced various challenges in, say, aligning Dickinson’s work to what, perhaps, or not, might have been Dickinson’s structural intentions, her enjambments, her meter, and her rhyme. In the technological age, the problem of forensic poetics does not lie with the crooked scraps of paper found in the hollow corners of a home. Instead, the majority of produced text is online, in cyberspace. And if a text is primarily lost in cyberspace, what quality about the arrangement and reproduction of Dickinson’s texts holds attributes of the lyric? What is lost in the technological transition of produced text and read/received text? What is lost is what is (mis)perceived.</p> 
                                          <p>This project intends to explore the moment of inception of a piece of writing. To determine what is lost in the translation of black symbols on a page, the representation of an idea, thought, emotion, expression that must, at some point, abide by the historical constructs of genre and literary movements. Criticism is always an afterthought. A critique of a work must, inherently, be based on a work previously produced. Thus, in drafting and redrafting, the writer becomes a kind of self-critic and inevitably moves toward the impulses of the critic, where one must abide by historicization and qualitative measures previously established. </p>
                                          <p>In creating a webpage that, in video recording the practice, displays the first-draft inception of a piece of writing, where the writer is producing a lyric piece, the trace back to the original intension of the author is a series of bifurcating revisional spaces, which demonstrates that the essay, the poem, the story, the narrative, is an impulsive act—one that displays the characteristics of the lyric as the form sees fit, and as the text deems necessary. With the video the reader/receiver is able to control the phenomenological trace of the work so that the retentional and protentional movement, the experience of the piece, holds no linear function. Rather the space/time movement of the piece radiates in all directions with sound, cadence, psychological and physiological impulses, and electromagnetic waves all translating some kind of immediate expressional movement toward understanding—at least one as closely related to the author’s subjective experience of creating the piece, the place closest to the re-birth of the author as the reader/receiver substantiates a second role as author. A place where the reader is in as close a proximally textual alignment with the writer. Where that gap of reader/receiver and writer knows no distance. </p>

                                          <p data-part="two" class="limit">We met at The Woodshed on 800 South. Dan shot pool but I beat Dan handily quarter-
                                          game after quarter-game and ridiculed his choice of shots even in his best moments. He 
                                          was creative on the felt and knew how not to lose, but he couldn’t slice down the rail and 
                                          his bank shots were 50-50. Isaac introduced us and played moderator to keep Dan from 
                                          suffering unrest—his tendency for emotional outbreaks and all. But after I banked the 
                                          eight on the long grain of the green I threw the stick on the table and grew bored of the 
                                          game and conversation and walked outside to my car, but behind me in short, silent steps 
                                          Dan followed with one hand nipping a cigarette and the other jammed in a pocket calling 
                                          my name. I didn’t know his, and made it a point to ask him as I entered his identity into 
                                          my phone as he insisted, You’re fucking awesome. I thought it odd. And I thought it weak 
                                          and submissive to so readily admit one’s adoration for another. But Dan, with all of his 
                                          oddities—his random jerking neck motions, his proclivity to vanish, his outbursts of 
                                          thought turned melody, his ability to close his eyes and nod through any conversation 
                                          with anyone—held no insistencies that those outside of his preference preferred him. His 
                                          nihilism was pure, sweet, tender, and prone toward curiosity and violence. So together, 
                                          we learned to push the weird. It wasn’t a difficult concept. It was basic. It was honest. 
                                          And it insisted that wonder be founded in promise. He called me two days after The 
                                          Woodshed and we began hanging out four or five nights a week. We decided over drinks 
                                          that while we were together we would ask lots of questions of strangers, but to any of their 
                                          questions we would always answer yes, which meant that we never said no. If someone 
                                          asked us if we wanted a shot, we said yes. If we were hailed to another bar, we said yes. If 
                                          a middle-aged Hispanic woman and her quiet friend who slowly drank pink liquid from a 
                                          tiny martini glass in a dive bar asked us to walk them back to their room at the Monaco 
                                          Hotel at 2:00 am when the cold promised snow only to leave us at the key-entry door, we 
                                          said yes. If a six-foot+ black man in a draping leather jacket wanted to buy us four shots a 
                                          piece of Johnny Walker Black and then ride in his busted sedan to the one titty bar in 
                                          town where tasseled nipples and barbecued pork ($5 extra on the cover) were on the 
                                          menu and 32 oz. beers were on tap while we lapsed into the neon laser glow disco of 
                                          glossed ass and hairsprayed hair, we said yes. And when a girl in a spaghetti-string top 
                                          and rattail dreadlocks asked us to come home with her after Dan sang to her that he 
                                          didn’t want a lap dance and after she tried time and again to assure him she wasn’t a 
                                          stripper, even as the cab pulled up to her one-bedroom loft where we played Scrabble in 
                                          Spanish and she beat us handily, touching Dan on the leg explaining his uniqueness and 
                                          then me on the shoulder informing me she wouldn’t sleep with me, we said yes. I took a 
                                          cab home after the blue light of dawn traced fan-blade shadows across her rippled ribcage 
                                          while her brown leather belt remained cinched. On the ride home, maybe I thought that 
                                          never saying no was a reaction to always being told no—the inverted transfer of control 
                                          landed squarely on a kid who didn’t know how to stop, and didn’t know why he should, 
                                          but I never felt regret at saying yes. And I never felt regret that she and I didn’t fuck.</p>

                                          <h4>In order to:</h4>

                                          <p>In Laird Hunt’s 2003 novel <em>Indiana, Indiana</em>, the beginning of each chapter is a script for a the book, a condensed version of the scenes in each chapter, heavily punctuated with all seven chapters designated by large, signifying numbers. The chapter to be read next and its brief description is bolded while the summaries of the previous and forthcoming chapters are pale gray, faded, as though not yet realized and not yet lived. The novel is reprinted seven times, at the beginning of each seven chapters. The story is here, still, on the page, recounting itself to it’s own memory, its own future. I can tell you, before reading chapter six, that there will be a “storm, a second helping of okra—witnesses, compositions of light—Noah receives a rifle, Noah fashions curious lenses” and so on. And so this project borrows that form of the living present emboldened in the past and what may come. </p> 
                                          <p>The original title to the piece on the webpage was, “The Ego of Alcohol”, and maybe that title is still the there, somewhere under all the analysis and criticism, but nowhere is it listed on the site. The subtitles under the opening photo are similarly the condensed script of each of the sections of the piece. The titles are arranged in chronological order, but that is not the order in which they appear in the essay. Effectively, each of these sections can be read out of order. There is no order. There are only images, scenes, happenings to be abutted next to other images, scenes, and happenings. What matters, what universalizes these images, what holds the attribute of the lyric in this essay is that the personal story—the solipsistic content—with the scenes contrived both in and out of time, opens the experience of the singular to a social sphere. This movement is necessary to the lyric. The essay abides by the rules it sets for itself, as are also necessary to the lyric.</p> 
                                          <p>To avoid the self-critic—she who begins to reorganize and mend the work according to learning, study, expectation, genre, historicization—the essay was constructed in one draft, over two sittings. The video of the writing at the bottom of the page is the second session of writing, the morning after the first one. The writer is noticeably hung over, slightly disoriented, detached from an outside world and sinking slowly back into the fabula of the essay while scanning the syuzhet. Here, the reader/receiver becomes an activator of the text, one who can control the timeline of the inception of the text by scrolling the time-bar below the video. What will appear is what is already before her in the navigable texts and images of the webpage above. </p>
                                          <p>The photographs mark a third layer of textual actualization that serves to simplify, or at least make readily available, the mystery of poetic forensics. In the Internet era, it seems, the confusion of Dickinson’s poems might reenact the ephemera as relic and, for this project, as an antiquated notion when discerning the intended organization of the lyric essay. </p>

                                          <h4>Abandon. A metal railing. The alone/Macedonia. Brother but not.</h4>
                                          <p data-part="three" class="limit">Dan wrote sex poems, and that’s as far as he got. He didn’t get into the MFA at the 
                                          University of Utah, but they offered him a spot in the MA program. He wrote that thesis 
                                          while we Pushed the Weird and then he took a year off to figure it all out. Dan went dark 
                                          for a while and we each drank a lot but alone. Texts never answered and yeses rarely 
                                          said. I heard from Isaac and later Dan that one night it went too far—but for Dan and I, 
                                          to get too far meant that something went wrong long ago. He moved into a new place 
                                          with his fiancée and had me over one night for drinks. We talked about strip clubs and 
                                          drugs and I mostly spoke while Dan giggled and smoked. It was spring in the Rockies and 
                                          cold and crisp and I twisted my fingers up and down the iron bars of the railing on his 
                                          balcony porch when he told me he hadn’t had but a glass of wine since New Year’s. Said 
                                          he lost it one night in a park downtown beneath the old oak trees and the well-kept grass. 
                                          Said that being drunk, that drunk, made him afraid. So afraid that he shook, that he 
                                          trembled, that he imagined conversations and places with people from pasts he didn’t 
                                          know or remember. His fiancée picked him up and after days and days Dan went sober. I 
                                          believed Dan, but I believed in a different kind of recovery more. I was certain that the 
                                          capacity of one’s liver could, in mere hours, alleviate one’s anxiety. And I left his house 
                                          that night on foot and walked downtown to a bar where I would rally a tab in the 
                                          attenuating hours of commerce better designed for those on holiday or in celebration. I 
                                          thought, then, that every occasion was an occasion to celebrate. And so every night, while 
                                          Dan was sober at home, I was out. I kept drinking. I kept seeking. And I kept saying yes. I 
                                          played pool at a little dive called Twilight where an old shooter with a bald head, trim 
                                          mustache, and military legs could beat me 50-50. I burped up a purple puddle of whisky 
                                          and wine on the front porch of that bar as I smoked a cigarette and waited out the queue 
                                          on the felt-green table. I walked home one night in a fit through a flurry and my brother 
                                          thankfully called me from his Peace Corps assignment in Macedonia. I told him I was 
                                          sorry, that I loved him, that I wanted him home. He assured me life was worth it and that 
                                          his phone card had limited minutes. But after I ran into Makena on the street, after he 
                                          helped me find my glasses that I’d pitched into the frost-stiff grass through wet, 
                                          blubbering sobs, and after I found home and slept in the stairwell of my apartment, after I 
                                          awoke and searched my phone for the Macedonian number to ask my brother, again, if it 
                                          was really worth it, and found no such number, but instead found out I didn’t talk to him 
                                          at all. That night, in some thick existence of memory-experience, I concocted an hour-
                                          long conversation with someone who perhaps had the presence to save me, or at least 
                                          preserve me a little longer.</p>

                                          <h4>(Re)Organizing the I:</h4>

                                          <p>In his book <em>Vanishing Point: Not a Memoir</em>, Ander Monson writes: “Each I encountered is a mouth we’re swallowed in.” The I here, the one in which the reader is gulped, is, for Jonathan Culler, an embarrassing mouth. For the lyric poet, the apostrophe, the calling out to unnamed or unknown or simply not-present loci “makes its point by troping not on the meaning of a word but on the circuit or situation of communication itself.” The apostrophe is embarrassing for Culler because of its commonality, its insignificance, its conventionality. Apostrophe calls out, but doesn’t all writing call out? Doesn’t every sign reach to signify, or at least approach the fringes of something recognizable, interpretable? For Culler, apostrophe also requires that the reader/receiver “[lose] our empirical lives: forgetting the temporality which supports them and trying to embrace a purely fictional time in which we can believe that the hand is really present and perpetually held toward us through the poem.” But in some cases of both essay and poem, the I is fictional, is contrived, and in the moments that Culler would deem embarrassing, they are simply not modes of the lyric. The poem and the essay will always possess attributes of apostrophe, but not every apostrophic poem or essay will be lyric. </p>
                                          <p>So there is still an I swallowing us as we read. Even now I can swallow the reader, reorganize their experience around facts and impressions, quotes and opinions, syllogisms and narratives.  And if this is the case, if the I is something projected and then called back, consuming receivers and then reprojecting language, we have at once the living present enacted by speech, the retentional trace held firm in the subject of the essay, and the protentional trace existing as a thing not yet enacted, not yet received. The trace exists in time, but does not bear attributes of time. It is the speech act, the phenomenological power of the voice that enacts a temporal relation with the interior self with the outside world. A quantifiable and measurable space, as Derrida notes, onto which sense is “issued forth from itself into the ‘expressive stratum’ of lived experience. Since the trace is the intimate relation of the living present with its outside, upon exteriority in general…<em>the temporalization of sense is, from the outset, a ‘spacing’” </em></p>
                                          <p>To speak, to write, to enact, to record, is how to feel. </p>
                                          <p>Time, for the apostrophic I in the essay, is the constant and the now, a kind of transitive continuity, that enacts the subject with the objective, and, as the external world is cognitively separated from the subject-as-producer of text, is also the moment of the personal and the communal. It is, as Adorno regards, “the subject—whose expression—as opposed to mere signification of objective contents—is necessary to attain that level of linguistic objectivity, is not something added to the contents proper to the layer, not something external to it.” The work of the I in the lyric is deeply personal and apostrophic: it reacts to social changes, injustices, it forms collective thinking and at some point of accumulation becomes in that collectivity both personal and social. “The lyric work,” Adorno continues, “hopes to attain universality through unrestrained individuation.” </p> 
                                          <p>In the section, “Dan. Pool. Slick skin. English letters in Spanish. The no to the no but yes.”, a list of images as examples is provided. The writer organizes the list around very personal and experience-based scenes and images that the reader/receiver is not expected or intended to know. But the list, presented in the conditional, might also be hypothetical. The I calls out for an understanding of the intentionality of the moment. The saying of yes to the experience on the page is the relatability, the willingness for the reader in the role of receiver to understand and reproduce for themselves in image, memory, or active self-creation based on the absurd and lengthy presentation of what, narratively, was never denied. Reasonably, as facts would be produced about the case, in the traditional exposition of a narrative and essay writing, the only information necessary is that the author and a friend always said yes. But much like the expansion of the titles of each section, so the form of the long paragraph and the hypotaxical sentences is the necessary shape of expansion the essay must take. </p>
                                          <p>The I here is egotistical, solipsistic, and sentimental. As Charles Olsen writes, “A poem is energy transferred from where the poet got it (he will have some several causations), by way of the poem itself to, all the way over to, the reader.” The I uses the transfer of energy not to exact a single reader, not a known apostrophic subject, but in a radiating glow extending from the text itself. The movement is ever expanding, and, as a piece of data on the Internet subject to search terms and innumerable electromagnetic reconstructions, unlike traditional paper text, the (re)actuality of the text can exist in the living now as a few seconds, a click and scroll, to however long the webpage and thus the text is used. But as the I in the “Dan. Pool…” section is organized as an apostrophic expansion, so is there another form closing in, reigning in the I to that gaping, swallowing maw. </p>

                                          <p data-part="four" class="limit">I stopped smoking weed because I wept when I was stoned reading Waiting for the
                                          Barbarians but still couldn’t really remember the story. I read it again with a magnum of 
                                          syrupy cabernet and remembered the opening line: “I have never seen anything like it:
                                          two little discs of glass suspended in front of his eyes in loops of wire.” Charles never wore 
                                          sunglasses when, after class, he followed me across campus balancing a slow bike as I 
                                          walked and asked me where I was from and what my story was. Behind the dark discs 
                                          suspended over the crook of my nose, I was relieved that he couldn’t see so close the 
                                          puffiness of my watery eyes. He told me my work was good. Wanted to know what I read. 
                                          Wanted to know where my parents went to college. Didn’t expect that my father laid 
                                          brick before installing alarm systems and my mother did data entry for the Utah State 
                                          Tax Commission. After I transferred schools and ended up in Francois’ workshop at the 
                                          University of Utah in Salt Lake City, he approached my on a brisk afternoon in the cold 
                                          canyon wind to tell me that my story reminded him of early Carver, right up until the 
                                          dialogue when it goes Hemingway, which isn’t a good thing. I told Megan and she told 
                                          me to give her a copy. Before she read The Potato Story we drank in mock-celebration of 
                                          a decent thing someone said about something I wrote. My brother and a few friends 
                                          joined us in the basement of a hip-hop club where I’d been before to skulk into the 
                                          stinking bathroom into a stall with a door but no lock where a Dominican kid assured me 
                                          that the coke he was crunching was pretty fucking good. I did a line and gummed a 
                                          pasted white pinky and never saw the DR kid again. Years later Megan said I did a good 
                                          job with the carpet in that story. She said, give me the banal. And that meant more than 
                                          the approval of published writers and PhDs. When she recalled the carpet I was pleased 
                                          that someone I loved loved something I made. I was an alchemist of alcohol transfiguring 
                                          paper and black symbols into something that someone felt. I saved all the work from 
                                          Charles’ class, from Francois’ class, on the hard drive of a hulking cube computer I 
                                          borrowed from my aunt. When she took it back and my cousin dismantled the machine 
                                          for parts, he blinked out all those words and all those pages when he separated the thin, 
                                          copper ribbons of the RAM from the motherboard. I was delighted that those drafts 
                                          drifted off into the ether—what was left has left, and the other day Megan again told me 
                                          to give her the banal.</p>

                                          <h4>Attributes of memoir in lyric:</h4>

                                          <p>The personal and the communal attributes that, for Adorno, the lyric must have, are permeable spaces, as long as the text does not succumb to personal ideologies. The construction of writing lyric essays bears with it the resistance to memoir, or the sacrifice of the lyric essay to the modes of memoir. For Ander Monson, “We are now reading self-absorbed fictional characters without realizing it. And what’s worse, that we don’t seem to understand (and thus use) this: that our stories borrow the self-importance of memoir… that they fail to consider form, that they don’t do what they need to do as fiction: to tell a compelling story.” The distinction made here, for Ander Monson, between fiction and the memoir, is that memoir relies on the self-importance that fiction must maintain in order to abide by the created space of the novel or short story. A world is created, abided by, but the structures of narrative must also be in place that we might <em>understand</em> and interpret the fiction as a good story. For memoir, the self-importance ostracizes the possibility of the personal moving to the social, and thus neither can be considered the lyric. Each form abides by the limitations of personal ideology, an ideology that accepts social ideologies, a form that collapses to external expectations—to what is restrained—to the “untruth, false consciousness, [and] deceit” of ideology. </p>
                                          <p>Adorno insists: “You experience lyric poetry as something opposed to society… that lyric expression, having escaped from the weight of material existence, evoke the image of a life free from coercion of reigning practices, of utility, of the relentless pressures of self-preservation.” For this experience, the untethered expression, be it for the writer or the reader, the movement—the creation and reception—of the lyric requires a communal space. How then does the lyric maintain an “unrestrained individuation” if its inherent attributes are “social in nature”? for Adorno, real ideology is not an altruistic personal expression. Rather that is the falseness and the façade of ideology. Rather, in language, “the more heavily the situation weighs upon it, the more firmly the work resists it by refusing to submit to anything heteronomous and constituting itself solely in accordance with its own laws.” For the essay, this becomes a mode of form and, always, the position of the I.</p>
                                          <p>After Ander Monson’s disparaging description of the current state of the memoir, of its desire to emerge and mitigate the lowest qualities of fiction, the author, in the last appearing section of the piece here deploys a singular interiority found in memoir: the reflection and reconciliation of past events, the desire for the previous images, after their random (dis)ordering, to present for the reader/receiver a curiosity for redemption. But the last line of the essay: “What am I trying to defend?” returns the reader/receiver to the traditional apostrophic qualities, those that Culler would call embarrassing. </p>
                                          <p>But before that, enacted in the moment and found in the video, is the impression of the previous writing, the previous sections, affecting the writer. The opening line of the section: “I want now not the story or memory to mean something, but the acts and actions.” Here the author reminds the reader/receiver (if this section is received last, otherwise simply stating) that the intent of the piece is that for the actions, the images, to mean something, for them to be considered, and not just these actions, all of his previous deleterious actions, which means the actions he portrays must also connect, at least linguistically, lyrically, in a way pleasing to read, with the reader/receiver. In short, the shallow atrocities must sound good. So before we return to the traditional apostrophe there is an insistence in the calling out that the rest of the essay, what is written and what is omitted, that the I that occurs 21 times in that section be what is both present and what is not. The author is always there, constructing. And then there is text, waiting with patient and furtive energy for the reader to activate what is and isn’t there. </p>
                                          <p>The memoir is there in the last section, in all of its self-reflexingly ugly ways, but it is necessary as to fit the form of the piece to fill in the gaps where the essay intentionally lacks the personal I, the I of the writer, reflecting on the images the apostrophic I has produced. The last section calls back the radiating qualities that the other sections only project. This movement of narrative proximity allows for reader/receiver to activate an I within the essay that is both personal and communal, that is idealistic only in that it abides by the rules the essay has set for itself. And it exacts a living present organized not in space and time, rather in projection and reception. There are no constants other than the constant of the essay, the moment of its inception, and the form necessary to, as Robert Creely regards it, “the extension of content.” </p>

                                          to mean something, but the acts and the actions. I want the accumulation of shit decisions and the resistance to reason to be more than a
                                          romanticized version of what a child thought a writer should be. Instead, now I have
                                          habits of bad practice and I’ve actualized a myth I regret I loved. There’s a moment back
                                          then, behind me, I’m certain, that if I just recognize and reveal, if I could speak it into
                                          being, then I could at least explain why I hold on to so much guilt and insistence. I
                                          thought that if I just read more, if I kept writing, if I was smarter, then I could locate that
                                          moment or that place where distraction turned into routine turned into practice turned
                                          into habit. And I still think that. What if I could trace that thin ribbon laced back through
                                          all those careless attempts at self-gratification? What if, in remembering, I located real
                                          compassion in close proximity to every drunken story I now recall light-heartedly to prop
                                          up as a defense? What am I trying to defend?</p>

                                          <h4>The form essential:</h4>

                                          <p>After scrolling to the bottom of the page, there is a video of the writer composing the last sections of the piece. This is the second session of writing and still the first draft of what is produced and provided above. The first session of the recording, which took place the previous night while a photographer stalked the home of the writer, recording a multiplicity of 1/1000<sup>th</sup>-of-a-second shots of the environment in which the writer wrote, and now writes, ended up in a four-hour screen-time video that was corrupted and thus unable to be uploaded to the website—a formal downfall of the breakdown of form. </p>
                                          <p>The original draft of the language is what’s important here. Not because a lyric essay or poem cannot be revised, or cannot be lyric if revised, but because the second draft, or the revision enacts criticism. And the writer becomes critic as soon as the piece is finished and opened to revision. All of the historicization of genre becomes the grounds for drafting revision. This produces a contrived notion of the lyric that Virginia Jackson, when considering Dickinson’s poems, regards “could be posed as statements about edition (the many ways in which Dickinson has or could be published) or statements about composition (the ways in which Dickinson wrote).” In short, when the editing begins, so does the organization of tradition, and from such moments the sacrifice of necessity in form is more likely to begin. </p>
                                          <p>For the video, the moment of inception of language can be controlled, manipulated—moved from future to past. The veracity of the sentences lies not in the accuracy of the action, but in the authenticity at which they are written. Derrida reminds us “The living present springs forth out of its nonidentity with itself and from the possibility of a retentional trace. It is always already a trace.” The trace recreated is immediate, carved out of sound and produced as shape on the screen. That moment is cut, with video, cut again with photographs, and recomposed in the text on the screen and as Olsen states it, the writer “put himself in the open—he can go by no track other than the one the poem under hand declares, for itself.” The act of writing and speech transfer reveals a moment of vulnerability. The words and sounds produced by the writer are immediately lost to the critic, to history, to whomever may read. </p>
                                          <p>This is not to suggest that the immediacy of the thing written is suddenly lyric. As Adorno refers to Goethe’s statement in <em>Maxims and Reflections</em>: that what you do not understand you do not posses. The academic rigor to understand how the piece is wrought as lyric is necessary, to some degree. But what is perhaps more important is that the work has the active pulse of something just rendered. Adorno: “Even lyric works in which no trace of conventional and concrete existence, no crude materiality remains, the greatest lyric works in our language, owe their quality to the force with which the “I” creates the illusion of nature emerging from alienation.” Here, Adorno states clearly exactly what is happening in the video, the photos, and on the website. Lyric can emerge out of drafting and editing, but in that space the quality of the natural and spontaneous are the necessary attributes of the lyric.</p>
                                          <hr/>
                                          <p>I have been using the terms <em>essay</em> and <em>poem</em> here intentionally interchangeably. And that is because the only difference, when regarding the lyric, is that poems are essays comprised of short sentences and enjambments, and essays are simply long-winded poems. The difference between the two is formal, and the formal only need regard language—the sound, the syllable, and the sentence. Language must appear to be unaware of the I, and the content and thus form must organize around the impulse of sound in order for the individual to address, and be heard, by the communal. “The unself-consciousness of the subject submitting itself to language as to something objective, and the immediacy and spontaneity of that subject’s expression are one and the same: thus language mediates lyric poetry and society in their inner most core.” There is lyric, and then there is something else. Lyric must formally abide by the individual constructs each piece sets forth, and be aware of its own insignificance. It must maintain an ideology that rejects the objective in order to (re)organize what is consistent in nature. And the subject will be successful when it “reaches an accord with language itself, with the inherent tendency of language.” And there, at the tendency of language is the living present calling back the retentional trace within a speech act, the illusion of the spontaneity of nature. </p>
