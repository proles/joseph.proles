              <h4>The Bar. The room. Darts. Luck and love.</h4>
              <p data-part="one" class="limit">On a summer afternoon after our breakfast/lunch shift ended at the diner in Emigration 
              Canyon, in Mulligan’s where those of us who loved those of us congregated, we shot 
              darts, sipped beer, and intermittently shot shots of cheap whiskey while the pale glow of 
              the sun reached through the open front door of the shotgun bar reminding us that there 
              was always something else out there. We didn’t dollar up the jukebox because Michael 
              always played the old hits and Classic Rock was a practice we three were reared in. Isaac 
              and Megan were lovers meant for only a short time, and that may have been why each of 
              them entertained the daytime debauchery that I was always so prone to. I lived across the 
              street in a studio we referred to as the Shoe Box—200 sq. ft. of soft green carpet and 
              whitewashed walls where we joked one could take a shit and fry an egg at the same time. 
              And on that day when the bar was empty and we were drinking after a long shift in the 
              canyon being terrorized by busloads of senior sightseers and demands of more ketchup 
              and condiments while we pulled Champagne shots at bent knee behind the patio bar, we 
              were drunk, but not that drunk. We were loving, but unsure about that love’s origins. 
              And from twenty feet away, crowding each other in a tan vinyl booth with arms latched 
              to shoulders and cheeks and lips at near embrace, I whipped a dart through the air and 
              called out: We shoot our whiskey and sip our darts. The plastic-feathered arrow sung true 
              through the nicotine fog and landed in the dead-center-dot of the red, pockmarked, 
              plastic dartboard and the machine buzzed out a dull, game-show-drone to let us know we 
              had to pay to play. The bull’s eye was dead-eyed and Isaac’s face sank in the wake of his 
              whooping, jubilant lover. I’ll never be that cool, he said. And meant it with conviction.</p>

              <h4>Dan. Pool. Slick skin. English letters in Spanish. The no to the no but yes.</h4>
              <p data-part="two" class="limit">We met at The Woodshed on 800 South. Dan shot pool but I beat Dan handily quarter-
              game after quarter-game and ridiculed his choice of shots even in his best moments. He 
              was creative on the felt and knew how not to lose, but he couldn’t slice down the rail and 
              his bank shots were 50-50. Isaac introduced us and played moderator to keep Dan from 
              suffering unrest—his tendency for emotional outbreaks and all. But after I banked the 
              eight on the long grain of the green I threw the stick on the table and grew bored of the 
              game and conversation and walked outside to my car, but behind me in short, silent steps 
              Dan followed with one hand nipping a cigarette and the other jammed in a pocket calling 
              my name. I didn’t know his, and made it a point to ask him as I entered his identity into 
              my phone as he insisted, You’re fucking awesome. I thought it odd. And I thought it weak 
              and submissive to so readily admit one’s adoration for another. But Dan, with all of his 
              oddities—his random jerking neck motions, his proclivity to vanish, his outbursts of 
              thought turned melody, his ability to close his eyes and nod through any conversation 
              with anyone—held no insistencies that those outside of his preference preferred him. His 
              nihilism was pure, sweet, tender, and prone toward curiosity and violence. So together, 
              we learned to push the weird. It wasn’t a difficult concept. It was basic. It was honest. 
              And it insisted that wonder be founded in promise. He called me two days after The 
              Woodshed and we began hanging out four or five nights a week. We decided over drinks 
              that while we were together we would ask lots of questions of strangers, but to any of their 
              questions we would always answer yes, which meant that we never said no. If someone 
              asked us if we wanted a shot, we said yes. If we were hailed to another bar, we said yes. If 
              a middle-aged Hispanic woman and her quiet friend who slowly drank pink liquid from a 
              tiny martini glass in a dive bar asked us to walk them back to their room at the Monaco 
              Hotel at 2:00 am when the cold promised snow only to leave us at the key-entry door, we 
              said yes. If a six-foot+ black man in a draping leather jacket wanted to buy us four shots a 
              piece of Johnny Walker Black and then ride in his busted sedan to the one titty bar in 
              town where tasseled nipples and barbecued pork ($5 extra on the cover) were on the 
              menu and 32 oz. beers were on tap while we lapsed into the neon laser glow disco of 
              glossed ass and hairsprayed hair, we said yes. And when a girl in a spaghetti-string top 
              and rattail dreadlocks asked us to come home with her after Dan sang to her that he 
              didn’t want a lap dance and after she tried time and again to assure him she wasn’t a 
              stripper, even as the cab pulled up to her one-bedroom loft where we played Scrabble in 
              Spanish and she beat us handily, touching Dan on the leg explaining his uniqueness and 
              then me on the shoulder informing me she wouldn’t sleep with me, we said yes. I took a 
              cab home after the blue light of dawn traced fan-blade shadows across her rippled ribcage 
              while her brown leather belt remained cinched. On the ride home, maybe I thought that 
              never saying no was a reaction to always being told no—the inverted transfer of control 
              landed squarely on a kid who didn’t know how to stop, and didn’t know why he should, 
              but I never felt regret at saying yes. And I never felt regret that she and I didn’t fuck.</p>

              <h4>Abandon. A metal railing. The alone/Macedonia. Brother but not.</h4>
              <p data-part="three" class="limit">Dan wrote sex poems, and that’s as far as he got. He didn’t get into the MFA at the 
              University of Utah, but they offered him a spot in the MA program. He wrote that thesis 
              while we Pushed the Weird and then he took a year off to figure it all out. Dan went dark 
              for a while and we each drank a lot but alone. Texts never answered and yeses rarely 
              said. I heard from Isaac and later Dan that one night it went too far—but for Dan and I, 
              to get too far meant that something went wrong long ago. He moved into a new place 
              with his fiancée and had me over one night for drinks. We talked about strip clubs and 
              drugs and I mostly spoke while Dan giggled and smoked. It was spring in the Rockies and 
              cold and crisp and I twisted my fingers up and down the iron bars of the railing on his 
              balcony porch when he told me he hadn’t had but a glass of wine since New Year’s. Said 
              he lost it one night in a park downtown beneath the old oak trees and the well-kept grass. 
              Said that being drunk, that drunk, made him afraid. So afraid that he shook, that he 
              trembled, that he imagined conversations and places with people from pasts he didn’t 
              know or remember. His fiancée picked him up and after days and days Dan went sober. I 
              believed Dan, but I believed in a different kind of recovery more. I was certain that the 
              capacity of one’s liver could, in mere hours, alleviate one’s anxiety. And I left his house 
              that night on foot and walked downtown to a bar where I would rally a tab in the 
              attenuating hours of commerce better designed for those on holiday or in celebration. I 
              thought, then, that every occasion was an occasion to celebrate. And so every night, while 
              Dan was sober at home, I was out. I kept drinking. I kept seeking. And I kept saying yes. I 
              played pool at a little dive called Twilight where an old shooter with a bald head, trim 
              mustache, and military legs could beat me 50-50. I burped up a purple puddle of whisky 
              and wine on the front porch of that bar as I smoked a cigarette and waited out the queue 
              on the felt-green table. I walked home one night in a fit through a flurry and my brother 
              thankfully called me from his Peace Corps assignment in Macedonia. I told him I was 
              sorry, that I loved him, that I wanted him home. He assured me life was worth it and that 
              his phone card had limited minutes. But after I ran into Makena on the street, after he 
              helped me find my glasses that I’d pitched into the frost-stiff grass through wet, 
              blubbering sobs, and after I found home and slept in the stairwell of my apartment, after I 
              awoke and searched my phone for the Macedonian number to ask my brother, again, if it 
              was really worth it, and found no such number, but instead found out I didn’t talk to him 
              at all. That night, in some thick existence of memory-experience, I concocted an hour-
              long conversation with someone who perhaps had the presence to save me, or at least 
              preserve me a little longer.</p>

              <h4>Charles. Francois. The carpet. The banal. Alchemy. And the ether.</h4>
              <p data-part="four" class="limit">I stopped smoking weed because I wept when I was stoned reading Waiting for the
              Barbarians but still couldn’t really remember the story. I read it again with a magnum of 
              syrupy cabernet and remembered the opening line: “I have never seen anything like it:
              two little discs of glass suspended in front of his eyes in loops of wire.” Charles never wore 
              sunglasses when, after class, he followed me across campus balancing a slow bike as I 
              walked and asked me where I was from and what my story was. Behind the dark discs 
              suspended over the crook of my nose, I was relieved that he couldn’t see so close the 
              puffiness of my watery eyes. He told me my work was good. Wanted to know what I read. 
              Wanted to know where my parents went to college. Didn’t expect that my father laid 
              brick before installing alarm systems and my mother did data entry for the Utah State 
              Tax Commission. After I transferred schools and ended up in Francois’ workshop at the 
              University of Utah in Salt Lake City, he approached my on a brisk afternoon in the cold 
              canyon wind to tell me that my story reminded him of early Carver, right up until the 
              dialogue when it goes Hemingway, which isn’t a good thing. I told Megan and she told 
              me to give her a copy. Before she read The Potato Story we drank in mock-celebration of 
              a decent thing someone said about something I wrote. My brother and a few friends 
              joined us in the basement of a hip-hop club where I’d been before to skulk into the 
              stinking bathroom into a stall with a door but no lock where a Dominican kid assured me 
              that the coke he was crunching was pretty fucking good. I did a line and gummed a 
              pasted white pinky and never saw the DR kid again. Years later Megan said I did a good 
              job with the carpet in that story. She said, give me the banal. And that meant more than 
              the approval of published writers and PhDs. When she recalled the carpet I was pleased 
              that someone I loved loved something I made. I was an alchemist of alcohol transfiguring 
              paper and black symbols into something that someone felt. I saved all the work from 
              Charles’ class, from Francois’ class, on the hard drive of a hulking cube computer I 
              borrowed from my aunt. When she took it back and my cousin dismantled the machine 
              for parts, he blinked out all those words and all those pages when he separated the thin, 
              copper ribbons of the RAM from the motherboard. I was delighted that those drafts 
              drifted off into the ether—what was left has left, and the other day Megan again told me 
              to give her the banal.</p>

              romanticized version of what<span data-player-seek="30">…</span> a child thought a writer should be. Instead, now I have
              habits of bad practice and I’ve actualized a myth I regret I loved. There’s a moment back
              then, behind me, I’m certain, that if I just recognize and reveal, if I could speak it into
              being, then I could at least explain why I hold on to so much guilt and insistence. I
              thought that if I just read more,<span data-player-seek="40">…</span> if I kept writing, if I was smarter, then I could locate that
